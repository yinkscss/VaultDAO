## Detailed Component Breakdown

### 🛡️ Smart Contract (`/contracts/vault`)

- **`src/lib.rs`**: Contains the protocol logic and main contract implementation.
- **`src/types.rs`**: Logic for data structures, roles, and enums used across the contract.
- **`src/storage.rs`**: Abstracted storage access patterns for Instance, Persistent, and Temporary storage.
- **`src/errors.rs`**: Definition of all contract-specific error codes returned to callers.
- **`src/test.rs`**: Automated test suite for validating multi-sig, timelocks, and limits.

### 💻 Frontend (`/frontend`)

- **`src/components/`**: UI building blocks (Modals, Cards, Buttons, Status Badges).
- **`src/hooks/`**: Custom React hooks for interacting with the blockchain.
  - `useVaultContract.ts`: Logic for invoking contract methods like `propose_transfer` or `approve_proposal`.
- **`src/pages/`**: Primary application views (Overview, Proposals, Settings).
- **`src/utils/`**: Helper functions for formatting addresses, dates, and amounts.

### 📚 Documentation (`/docs`)

- **`TESTING.md`**: Guide on running and writing contract tests.
- **`DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Instructions for deploying to Testnet and Mainnet.
- **`API.md`**: Technical reference for contract functions and data types.
- **`PITCH.md`**: Project overview for reviewers and stakeholders.
- **`WAVE_ISSUES.md`**: Specific tasks for Stellar Drips Wave contributors.

### 📜 Root Files

- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: High-level system design and data flow diagrams.
- **`ROADMAP.md`**: Project milestones and planned feature updates.
- **`LICENSE`**: AGPL-3.0 License details.
